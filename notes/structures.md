## Main concepts
1. Require the character to make a choice,
2. show that choice by actions, and
3. those actions must have consequences.

## Story flow
1. *First line or two,* Introduce the most startling or grabby thing about your characters/setting/situation.
2. *Rest of the first paragraph* Lay out character/setting/ and most of all problem.  You might want to lead with problem as that brings out the most interesting things about your idea.  (If your idea isn’t interesting, WHY are you writing it?).
3. *Next few pages (From the first paragraph up to the 25% mark).* Develop the present situation which your character is caught.  This situation is usually not the main problem, and you should have at least one try/fail before getting character out of the PRESENT situation.  About 1/4 of the way through the story, have the character realize what the REAL problem is.
4. *From the 25% point to the mid-point* Initiate try/fails to solve the main problem.
5. *Mid-point* Around middle of the story have character realize he was going about obtaining goal the wrong way or that his/her assumptions were very wrong.
6. *62% (between the mid-point and the 3/4 mark)* Activate cunning plan.
7. *75% mark* Try fail sequences set up about 3/4 through the story.
8. *88% mark* Black moment about 1/8th from the end.
9. *95% to 100%* Resolution and usually not much of a cigarette moment, because it’s a short.

### A Character, In A Situation, With A Problem.
1. A character,
2. in a situation,
3. with a problem,
4. who tries repeatedly to solve the problem,
5. but fails, usually making the problem worse.
6. At the climax of the story the hero makes a final attempt which may succeed or fail.
7. The result of the hero's final attempt is validated in a way that makes it clear what we saw was the final result.

### Hero’s Journey:
1. The hero is confronted with a challenge,
2. rejects it,
3. but then is forced (or allowed) to accept it.
4. then travels on the road of trials,
5. gathering powers and allies, and
6. confronts evil—only to be defeated.
7. This leads to a dark night of the soul, after which the hero makes a leap of faith that allows him to confront evil again and be victorious.
