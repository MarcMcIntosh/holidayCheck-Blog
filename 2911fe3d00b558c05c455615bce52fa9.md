# Day Six, ToDo - Time Management.
Since slipping a day or two behind on blog posts and some tasks taking slightly longer the anticipated it's become apparent that the current way I allocate time to each task of my day could be greatly improved.

Thus far I've been short sighted in prioritising the problems immediately ahead for me over long-term strategies and potential opportunities to improve. Today's mentorship focused on providing practical advice and habits that should assist in rectifying this issue before it causes some major problems.

The main focus of this session was building a structure in which a day can be broken down in and time slots allocated to certain activities. Some of time slots are allocated to fixed time activities such as katas, meetings and blogging. This leaves my schedule open for division among other tasks that could be done each day or done during set days of the week.

Only time will tell if it works :)
