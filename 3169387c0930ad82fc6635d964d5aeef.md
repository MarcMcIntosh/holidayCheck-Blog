# Soon after Shipping
So in the last post I was ranting about how I had published this blog while the frame work was not working as intended. Being unhappy with this I spent part of today debugging and trying to get the bare minium functionality out of it in order to say it works as intended. The good news is it works, the bad news is that this did result in me resorting to my default habit of debugging rather than writing a full set of tests.

Although, the rush did force me to prioritise the basic requirements of the blog and focus on getting those working. The result being a very plain ( no style sheets ) blog that works and can be updated when required, although with out tests it's hard to verify that the updates won't break anything.
