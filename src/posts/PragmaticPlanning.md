# Pragmatic Planning.

A large portion of today and a small amount of the previous day I've been trying to plan out my activities during my apprenticeship with holiday check... roughly 23 weeks from today (Thursday 20th September 2018).

 I tend to have many tabs open in my browser, so a web organisational tool would most likely stay in a tab and be continually overlooked by things like emails, documentation and blogs I haven't quite finished reading yet.

 A more suitable option (for myself) is to use sticky notes. writing one activity, tool, technique, category, challenge or phase per note and colour coordinating them. These where quickly strewn over my desk as I tried to find some way of correlating phase, activities and tools by category (tools, testing, software design, agile, communication and learning) along with the individual challenges laid out in front of me.

 I spent some time staring at this unorganised mess trying to figure out what activities co-relate. Tl;dr - there's a lot of overlap, to much for for my desk to handle after looking at the floor and briefly considering laying them out there.

 Eventually the notion of drawing a pyramid like diagram out of some of the notes phases would help me to organises all of the sticky notes, so that's what I did with the categories along the bottom organised along the horizontal axis working from the outside in with the hard skills on the out side and softer sills on the inside, and phase / time as the vertical axis. This worked out quite well as things like communication and learning will be ongoing through out my apprenticeship while being exposed to tools and techniques will be very useful in the phases.  

 What's left to do now is figure out where all the challenges fit in...
