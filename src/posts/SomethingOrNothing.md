# Shipping something is better than shipping nothing.

So in the process of writing this blog / site most the time the project has not evolved further than a "hello" screen as I spend a lot of time configuring the build process and thinking about different ways to approach the various criteria. Which often leads to second guessing everything and wasting time that could be put to better use.

The result being a blog that consists of nothing more that a greeting and a list of posts that should be up. Personally I would rather wait until I had a functional prototype before publishing anything but I've been advised I ought to show what I've got so far, I think the idea here is to encourage continuous integration of each feature.
