# Retrospect - Time Management

The last blog post was about implementing a self organisation technique aimed at effectively managing my daily schedule. So this blog will be about evaluating the early outcomes of scheduling my activities for the day.

## Things I scheduled
+ __09:00__ kata.
+ __09:45__ Find out more details about presenting a talk on Friday.
+ __10:30__ Daily standup meeting.
+ __11:00__ Discuss reading materials with co-workers and an cohesive approach to learning the materials.
+ __12:00__ Read the apprenticeship wiki ***(should been have done on day one)***.
+ __14:00__ Plan activities and time frames for tasks to do during the next six months.
+ __15:00__ Blog.
+ __End__ Plan for tomorrow.

## Things that have happened, so far.
+ __09:00__ Rush to work.
+ __09:45__ Found out more information about the talk on Friday, I'm organising and speaking at it.
+ __10:30__ Got offered an introduction to the nix package manager during the Daily meeting.
+ __11:00__ Read an other chapter of the ***"The software craftsmanship"*** and suggesting that the occasional group discussion of a chapter would help in absorbing the materiel.
+ __12:30__ Read the apprenticeship wiki, __there are a few things I still have to do from the on boarding process__.
+ __14:00__ Go for a quick introduction to the nix package manager.
+ __15:00__ Blogging.

Overall I would have say that planning out, and committing to the plan has help to give my day some structure along with preventing to much procrastination from and distraction by my activities.
