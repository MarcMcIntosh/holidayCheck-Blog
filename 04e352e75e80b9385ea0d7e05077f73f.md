#TDD TFP TLDR

A practice that's being covered / enforced in our coding practices at holidayCheck is testing. Personally I normally debug rather than write out tests. Although in large projects speared out among multiple developers the benefits of having a system to check what works and doesn't become very apparent.

Two of the approaches that we have briefly discussed or been introduced to are:
+ Test Driven Development [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
+ Test First Programming [TFP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html)

Test first Programming is the easiest to explain, TFP basically starts with knowing what result the code should produce and before writing any of the code to be tested  the tests are written and optionally run.

Test Driven Development on the other hand could also be called test driven design as ( once again before any of the programs code) test are written out similar to TFP, but the difference being that TDD requires the writer to think about the what the minimal requirements of the program are before starting the project. This allows for a much faster design as opposed to writing and debugging a large project on step at a time.
