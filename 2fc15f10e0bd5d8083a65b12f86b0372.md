# Third Day, Blogged down.

With almost everything up and working we where given a fwe assignments to do, one of which is to write about our expreinces and activities at holodayCheck in a blog. English was never my strongest subject at school so I figured I better make it easier to write content that made some sort of sense and began look for structures to use in short stories.

Most of what I found was the same phylisophy just worded diffrently.

+ __First paragraph__ Grab the readers attention with an intresting thing about the character, situation or setting. Then spend the rest of the paragraph developing the scenario.
+ __Rest of the first quarter__ Develope a small situation in which the character is caught in, which leads on to the real bigger problem.
+ __Up to the mid point__ have the character strugle with the larger problem.
+ __Mid point__ Have the character realize why they are strugelling to much.
+ __Three quarters of the why through__ The character finds a method to over come the situation, and begins implimenting the method with some success and some failure.
+ __Ending__ Clarify it situation resolved or not

It's a pretty simple structure but definalty helps make the blogging more managble, especially if writting is not your best ability ;)
